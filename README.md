# Openseadragon
I have created a simple HTML page for working on Deep Zoom Images using Openseadragon. I have further added OpenseadragonAnnotorious plugin to annotate the image. 
Deep Zoom composer was used to create the testpattern .xml image. 

## Run the code
We will have to change our our browser's local files security policy to load the zooming data. Alternatively, we can run a local server. To run a local server execute these commands.
```
npm install http-server -g
http-server . -p 8000
go to localhost:8000
```
